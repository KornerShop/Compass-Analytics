# Compass-Analytics 💡
Compass Analytics receives and displays real time data from [Compass](https://github.com/KornerShop/Compass-Native), our React Native mobile app. This data reflects anonymous information about users such as: language preference, location (by way of zip code), number of times users initiated map navigation for both SNAP and WIC offices, and which office the user wanted to locate. 

## Why is this information important? 
We envision this data being used by government agencys, foodbanks or non-profits whose mission it is to better understand the needs of low income families/individuals. This information can help inform how to better allocate resources and time. We want to contribute to a bottom up approach, by way of data, to help make government resources more accessible.
