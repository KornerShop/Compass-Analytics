# Compass-Analytics 💡
Compass Analytics receives and displays real time data from Compass, our React Native mobile app. This data reflects anonymous information about users such as language preference, location (by way of zip code), the number of times users initiated map navigation for both SNAP and WIC offices, and which office the user wanted to locate.

## Why is this information important?
We envision this data being used by government agencies, food banks or nonprofits whose mission it is to better understand the needs of low-income families/individuals. This information can help inform how to better allocate resources and time. We want to contribute to a bottom up approach, by way of data, to help make government resources more accessible.
