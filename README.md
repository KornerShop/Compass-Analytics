# Compass-Analytics
Compass Analytics receives and displays real time data from [Compass](https://github.com/KornerShop/Compass-Native), our React Native mobile app. This data reflects anonymous information about users such as: language preference, location (by way of zip code), number of times users initiated map navigation for both SNAP and WIC offices, and which office the user wanted to locate. 

## Why is this information important? 
We envision this data being used by government agencys, foodbanks or non-profits whose mission it is to better understand the needs of low income families/individuals. Perhaps this information can help to inform which zip codes are in the most need of assistance, or how many bilingual employees should be employed at various SNAP/WIC offices. This data can serve as a small piece of the puzzle when trying to discover a bottom up approach for making government resources more accessible.
